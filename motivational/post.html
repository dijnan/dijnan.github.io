                        <p>A gentleman was walking through an elephant camp, and he spotted that the elephants weren‚Äôt being kept in cages or held by the use of chains.
                            All that was holding them back from escaping the camp, was a small piece of rope tied to one of their legs.</p>
                        <p>As the man gazed upon the elephants, he was completely confused as to why the elephants didn‚Äôt just use their strength to break the rope and escape the camp. They could easily have done so, but instead, they didn‚Äôt try to at all.</p>
                        <p>Curious and wanting to know the answer, he asked a trainer nearby why the elephants were just standing there and never tried to escape.</p>
                        <p>The trainer replied;<br>‚Äúwhen they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it‚Äôs enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.‚Äù</p>
                        <p>The only reason that the elephants weren‚Äôt breaking free and escaping from the camp was that over time they adopted the belief that it just wasn‚Äôt possible.</p>

                        <p>As a group of frogs was traveling through the woods, two of them fell into a deep pit. When the other frogs crowded around the pit and saw how deep it was, they told the two frogs that there was no hope left for them.</p>
                        <p>However, the two frogs decided to ignore what the others were saying and they proceeded to try and jump out of the pit. Despite their efforts, the group of frogs at the top of the pit were still saying that they should just give up. That they would never make it out.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, one of the frogs took heed to what the others were saying and he gave up, falling down to his death. The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and just die.<br>He jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs said, ‚ÄúDid you not hear us?‚Äù<br>The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time.</p>
